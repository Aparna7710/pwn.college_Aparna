# Comprehending Commands 03 - more catting practice
This task teaches us how to cat files with direct path.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{sa-xdEAimzdF_A7DvuL13XY_c1L.QXwITO0wSN2kjNzEzW}`

Following the question instructions, I just used the direct path given with the cat command.

```bash
You cannot use the 'cd' command in this level, and must retrieve the flag by
absolute path. Plus, I hid the flag in a different directory! You can find it
in the file /usr/share/racket/flag. Go cat it out **without** cding into that
directory!
~$ cat /usr/share/racket/flag
pwn.college{sa-xdEAimzdF_A7DvuL13XY_c1L.QXwITO0wSN2kjNzEzW}
```
