# Comprehending Commands 02 - Catting absolute paths
This task helps us to understand how to cat files that are not in your home directory and so their absolute paths have to specified.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Q5wPKndk7MlPEG3YLLJghB5UI4I.QX5ETO0wSN2kjNzEzW}`

I followed the task instructions and just typed cat /flag to access the flag 

```bash
$ cat /flag
pwn.college{Q5wPKndk7MlPEG3YLLJghB5UI4I.QX5ETO0wSN2kjNzEzW}
```
