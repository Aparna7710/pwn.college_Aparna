# Pondering Paths 02 - Program and absolute paths
This task aims to familiarise us with more complex directories.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{03cB3cQYSsw4ke5MU6DeYnpppHP.QX1QTN0wSN2kjNzEzW}`

```bash
$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{03cB3cQYSsw4ke5MU6DeYnpppHP.QX1QTN0wSN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
It taught me how to access programs which themselves are within another program.
