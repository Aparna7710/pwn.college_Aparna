# Shell Variables 07 - Reading Input
This challenge teaches us how to accept input.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{IiUnbbxPiZMEGnsfdFRBJEH1vth.QX4cTN0wSN2kjNzEzW}`

Following the instructions, I used the read command to read input from the user into the PWN variable.

```bash
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ read -p "INPUT: " PWN
INPUT: COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{IiUnbbxPiZMEGnsfdFRBJEH1vth.QX4cTN0wSN2kjNzEzW}
```
