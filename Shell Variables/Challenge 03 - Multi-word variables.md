# Shell variables 03 - Multi-word variables
This challenge teaches us how we can setup multi word variables.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Y4RGZ4eNLy6EhdJu6HElNbzS2nU.QXwYTN0wSN2kjNzEzW}`

Following the challenge instructions, I setup the variable PWN to COLLEGE YEAH with the help of " ".

```bash
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{Y4RGZ4eNLy6EhdJu6HElNbzS2nU.QXwYTN0wSN2kjNzEzW}
```
