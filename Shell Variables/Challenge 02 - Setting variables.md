# Shell variables 02 - Setting variables
This challenge teaches us how to set/initialise variables.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{MA7is31o-OFzQxbL7rEyhocJrkD.QX5UTN0wSN2kjNzEzW}`

Following the challenge instructions, I set the PWN variable to COLLEGE and accessed the flag.

```bash
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{MA7is31o-OFzQxbL7rEyhocJrkD.QX5UTN0wSN2kjNzEzW}
```
