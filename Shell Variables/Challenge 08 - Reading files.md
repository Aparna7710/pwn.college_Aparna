# Shell Variables 08 - Reading files
This challenge teaches us the method for reading a file into an environment.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{4Iy1wjIqVG9s448LlwI2UOCCwfe.QXwIDO0wSN2kjNzEzW}`

Following the challenge instructions, I read the output of the /challenge/run directory into the PWN variable.

```bash
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$ read PWN < /challenge/read_me
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{4Iy1wjIqVG9s448LlwI2UOCCwfe.QXwIDO0wSN2kjNzEzW}
```
