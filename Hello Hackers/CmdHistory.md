# Hello Hackers 03 - Command History
This task helps us to learn how to access command history using arrow keys.

## My solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{MO1G7WkTs7Qg-T0XjHUFcdhHB6k.0lNzEzNxwSN2kjNzEzW}

continuing from the previous task, After finishing it i started the next task which again bought back the Connected message. From there I pressed
the upper arrow key to get the flag.

```bash
Connected!
^ (upper arrow key)
the flag is pwn.college{MO1G7WkTs7Qg-T0XjHUFcdhHB6k.0lNzEzNxwSN2kjNzEzW}
```


## What I learned
It taught me how to access the previous commands.
