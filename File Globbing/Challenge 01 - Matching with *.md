## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{helloworld}`

Since the challenge specified that the argument should be lesser than 4 characters, I simply passed cd /ch* utilising the * command.

```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /ch*
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{QJx47m-3Pawl9tvudQ1oKE-aFDU.QXxIDO0wSN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned 
This challenge taught me how to use the * command to find files of similar pattern.
