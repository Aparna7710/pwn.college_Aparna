# File Globbing 03 - Matching with []
This challenge teaches us the use of [] command as a more specific version of the ? command.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{oJcI6Px6QW1NHx77UqB-Y4K8i2S.QXzIDO0wSN2kjNzEzW}`

Followed the question instructions and first accessed the /challenge/files directory after which I passed arguments using [] to /challenge/run

```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run file_[bash]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{oJcI6Px6QW1NHx77UqB-Y4K8i2S.QXzIDO0wSN2kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
